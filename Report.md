# C1-GarbageCollection Challenger's Report

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: C1-CodeAnnotations
**Date of Review**: 15/01/2024
**Challenger**: Giorgio Bellia

The C1-GarbageCollectios is a project that focuses on creation and exploration of the concept of garbage collection. Garbage collection is a process in programming languages where the system automatically identifies and frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use or referenced by the program. This process allows to reclaim memory that is not used, improving overall system performance.
In this report, I critically review the project considering three main aspects: [Project Structure](#project-structure), [code quality](#code-quality) and [functionality](#functionality). Also, I provide recommendations for future enhancements and personal proposals.

### Project Structure
Both python scripts are well-organized and follow a modular structure. Their functions have a clear scope and are self contained. Classes are defined for garbage collectors, and functions are used appropriately for specific functionalities. The README file is highly detailed, it offers code snippets to visualize better what each part of code does. Descriptions are concise but give a general picture of the program and the presence of references and visual media gives the oppurtunity to dig for more details. I propose to add a table of contents.

### Code Quality
All the scripts contain helpful comments that explain the purpose and functionality of various sections of the code. Comments provide insights into the design decisions and simulate the behavior of the garbage collectors. The code is generally readable and names are descriptive, making it easy to understand the purpose of each component. Error handling is minimal, in the python scripts there is no handling for edge cases like trying to allocate an object when the heap is full. 

### Functionality 
All programs function as expected, they serve their educational purpose effectively. However, they are intentionally simplified for learning purposes. In practice, developers rarely have to manually manage memory; in fact, these scripts simulate memory allocation and deallocation, but it's crucial to emphasize that these simulations do not interact with real memory. Manual memory management is not common in standard development. However, real-world garbage collection involves more sophisticated algorithms.
